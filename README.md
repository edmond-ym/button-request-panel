# Button Request System

Welcome to the Button Request System! This project is designed to streamline the process of sending repeated messages in environments like restaurants, where customers can use a dedicated device to request assistance easily. When a customer presses a button on the device, an HTTP request is sent to a server, and a pre-configured message corresponding to the device's Unique ID is sent to the staff.
